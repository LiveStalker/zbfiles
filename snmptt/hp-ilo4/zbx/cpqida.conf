FORMAT ZBXTRAP $ar Controller Status Change (3033): Controller status is now $5 for controller located in $3.
SDESC
Controller Status Change.
This trap signifies that the agent has detected a change in
the status of a drive array controller.  The variable
cpqDaCntlrBoardStatus indicates the current controller status.
User Action: If cpqDaCntlrBoardStatus is 'generalFailure(3)', you
may need to reboot the server or replace the controller.  
After the system is rebooted, check the variable 
cpqDaCntlrLastLockupCode for the controller’s last lockup code. 
If cpqDaCntlrBoardStatus is 'cableProblem(4)', check the cable 
connections between the controller and the storage system. If 
cpqDaCntlrBoardStatus is 'cacheModuleMissing(6)', the array
controller is operating in an unsupported configuration and
requires that a cache module be attached to the controller.
